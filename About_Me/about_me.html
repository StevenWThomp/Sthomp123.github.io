     <h1> A summary of my goals </h1>
     <p>
       &#8195;I've always been drawn to mostly anything within the umbrella of the
       STEM field. I guess that during high school I've specialized
       myself under the flag of computer science, I plan to branch
       out into the realm of computer engineering in college.<br>
       &#8195;I think that understanding
       both the process of creating software and how to create the increasingly
       complex circuitry involved in computing will be integral to the field
       in which I want to pursue: Embedded systems.
