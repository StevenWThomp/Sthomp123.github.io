     For each of the first two questions, write out your best guess as to what the
     code will print. Clearly label this as your guess. Then run the code and look at
     the output. Write if your guess was correct. If it was not, briefly describe what
     was different and why.

     Predicting what the code will do is important in writing programs, and
     figuring out why programs don't run the way expected.
     
  1. What does this program print out?
     (Remember: TWO answers. Your guess and the actual result. Label both.)
     
     Guess: it is going to keep printing 0 on separate lines and never stop.
     Answer: it printed 0,2,4,6,8 on separate lines and stopped but didn't print 10. I didn't see that x was reassigned at first.
     x = 0
     while x < 10:
         print(x)
         x = x + 2
     
  2. What does this program print out?
     Guess: It will print 1,2,4,8,16,32 on separate lines.
     Answer: It will print 1,2,4,8,16,32 on separate lines.
     x = 1
     while x < 64:
         print(x)
         x = x * 2
     
  3. Why is the and x >= 0 not needed?
     This loop will never go below 0 so that makes it unnecessary to have a check for it going below 0.
     x = 0
     while x < 10 and x >= 0:
         print(x)
         x = x + 2
     
  4. What does this program print out? (0 pts) Explain. (1 pt)
     It prints out 5,4,3,2,1,0 but never prints "Blast off!" because the if statement checks if 1 is a string.
     x = 5
     while x >= 0:
         print(x)
         if x == "1":
             print("Blast off!")
         x = x - 1
     
  5. Fix the following code so it doesn't repeat forever, and keeps asking
     the user until he or she enters a number greater than zero: (2 pts)
     
     x = float(input("Enter a number greater than zero: "))

     while x <= 0:
         print("Too small. Enter a number greater than zero: ")
         x = float(input("Enter a number greater than zero: "))
     
  6. Fix the following code:
     
     x = 10

     while x > 0:
         print(x)
         x -= 1

     print("Blast-off")
     
  7. What is wrong with this code? It runs but it has unnecessary code.
     Find all the unneeded code. Also, answer why it is not needed. (1 pt)
     
     for i in range(10):
         print(i)
     The for loop sets i as a variable already so defining it outside of the for loop is pointless.
  
  8. Explain why the values printed for x are so different. (2 pts)
        
        # Sample 1
        x = 0
        for i in range(10):
            x += 1
        for j in range(10):
            x += 1
        print(x)

        # Sample 2
        x = 0
        for i in range(10):
            x += 1
            for j in range(10):
                x += 1
        print(x)
        
        The printed values are different because in the second sample the for loop is nested. This causes it to run through every number between 10, 9 times. Whereas, since sample 1 does not have nested for loops, it just counts the numbers in the range of 10 twice and adds them together.
