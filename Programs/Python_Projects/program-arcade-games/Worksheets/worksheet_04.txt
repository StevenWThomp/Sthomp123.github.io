     Reminder: Please use full sentences, capital letters, and proper grammar
     where appropriate.
     Don't create a loop that only loops once. That doesn't make sense.
     Python runs the code once by default anyway. Avoid loops like this:
     
     for i in range(1):
         # Do something.
     
     
  1. Write a Python program that will use a for loop to print your name
     10 times, and then the word ``Done'' at the end.

for name in range(1,11):
    print("Steven Thompson")
print("Done")

	 
	 
  2. Write a Python program that will use a for loop to print ``Red''
     and then ``Gold'' 20 times. (Red Gold Red Gold Red Gold... all on separate lines.
     Don't use \n.)

    for word in range(1,21):
        print("red gold")
                    

  3. Write a Python program that will use a for loop to print the even
     numbers from 2 to 100, inclusive.

    for even in range(2,101,2)
        print("even")

  4. Write a Python program that will use a while loop to count from
     10 down to, and including, 0. Then print the words ``Blast off!'' Remember, use
     a WHILE loop, don't use a FOR loop.

    number = 11
    while number != 0:
        number = number -1
        print(number)
    print("Blast off!")

  5. There are three things wrong with this program. List each. (3 pts)
    1. x needs to = int(input())
    2. you want to make the total += to x, not i.
    3. The print statement should print the total, not "x"
     print("This program takes three numbers and returns the sum.")
     total = 0

     for i in range(3):
         x = input("Enter a number: ")
         total = total + i
     print("The total is:", x)
     
  6. Write a program that prints a random integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive).

    import random
    print(random.randint(1,10))

  7. Write a program that prints a random floating point number somewhere between
     1 and 10 (inclusive). Do not make the mistake of generating a random number from
     0 to 10 instead of 1 to 10.

    import random
    number = random.randint(1,10)
    print(float(number))

  8. Write a Python program that will: (3 pts)
     * Ask the user for seven numbers
     * Print the total sum of the numbers
     * Print the count of the positive entries, the number entries equal to zero,
     and the number of negative entries. Use an if, elif, else chain, not just three
     if statements.
     
total = 0
count_positive = 0
count_negative = 0
zero = 0

for i in range(7):
    numbers = int(input("Enter your number: "))
    total += numbers
    if numbers <= -1:
        count_negative += 1
    elif numbers >= 1:
        count_positive += 1
    else:
        zero += 1
print("amount of negative numbers:", str(count_negative))
print("amount of positive numbers:", str(count_positive))
print("amount of times zero was entered:", str(zero))
print("The sum of the numbers:", total)



  9. Coin flip tosser: (4 pts)     
     * Create a program that will print a random 0 or 1.
     * Instead of 0 or 1, print heads or tails. Do this
     using if statements. Don't select from a list, as shown in the chapter.
     * Add a loop so that the program does this 50 times.
     * Create a running total for the number of heads flipped, and the number of tails.

import random
total_heads = 0
total_tails = 0
for i in range(50):
    random_number = random.randint(0,1)
    if random_number == 1:
        total_heads += 1
        print("heads")
    elif random_number == 0:
        total_tails += 1
        print("tails")
print("Amount of times heads was flipped:", total_heads)
print("Amount of times tails was flipped:", total_tails)

     
 10. Write a program that plays rock, paper, scissors: (4 pts)
     
     * Create a program that randomly prints 0, 1, or 2.
     * Expand the program so it randomly prints rock, paper, or scissors
     using if statements. Don't select from a list, as shown in the chapter.
     * Add to the program so it first asks the user their choice.
     * (It will be easier if you have them enter 1, 2, or 3.)
     * Add conditional statement to figure out who wins.

import random
random_number = random.randint(0,2)
print("Press 0 to select rock")
print("Press 1 to select paper")
print("press 2 to select scissors")
user_choice = int(input("Make your choice: "))
if user_choice == 0 and random_number == 2:
    print("The computer has chosen scissors. You Win!")
elif user_choice == 0 and random_number == 1:
    print("The computer has chosen paper. You lose :(")
elif user_choice == 1 and random_number == 0:
    print("The computer has chosen rock. You Win!")
elif user_choice == 1 and random_number == 2:
    print("The computer has chosen scissors. You lose :(")
elif user_choice == 2 and random_number == 1:
    print("The computer has chosen paper. You Win!")
elif user_choice == 2 and random_number == 0:
    print("The computer has chosen rock. You lose :(")
elif user_choice == random_number:
    print("It's a draw, the computer has picked the same thing as you.")
