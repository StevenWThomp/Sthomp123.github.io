     NOTE: In the following problems, if an error prevents an example from running, make
     certain to mention that as part of the results. Also, be precise. If program prints [1],
     doesn't say it prints 1.

     
  1. List the four types of data we've covered, and give an example of each:
        String: ("My name is Steven Thompson")
        Intger: (3)
        Floating point: (3.534)
        Boolean: (True)

  2. What does this code print out? For this and the following problems, make
     sure you understand WHY it prints what it does. You don't have to explain it,
     but if you don't understand why, make sure to ask.
     Otherwise you are wasting your time doing these.
     
     my_list = [5, 2, 6, 8, 101]
     print(my_list[1])
     print(my_list[4])
     print(my_list[5])
    
    It prints out 2, 101, and then errors saying "Index out of range". This is because it starts counting at 0 instead of 1.
    
  3. What does this code print out?
     
     my_list=[5, 2, 6, 8, 101]
     for my_item in my_list:
         print(my_item)
     5
     2
     6
     8
     101
     
  4. What does this code print out?
     
     my_list1 = [5, 2, 6, 8, 101]
     my_list2 = (5, 2, 6, 8, 101)
     my_list1[3] = 10
     print(my_list1)
     my_list2[2] = 10
     print(my_list2)
     
     [5,2,6,10,101]
     TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
     
  5. What does this code print out?
     
     my_list = [3 * 5]
     print(my_list)
     my_list = [3] * 5
     print(my_list)
     
     [15]
     [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
     
  6. What does this code print out?
     
     my_list = [5]
     for i in range(5):
     	my_list.append(i)
     print(my_list)
     
     [5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
     
  7. What does this code print out?
     
     print(len("Hi"))
     print(len("Hi there."))
     print(len("Hi") + len("there."))
     print(len("2"))
     print(len(2))
     
    2
    9
    8
    1
    builtins.TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()
     
  8. What does this code print out?
     
     print("Simpson" + "College")
     print("Simpson" + "College"[1])
     print( ("Simpson" + "College")[1] )
     
    SimpsonCollege
    Simpsono
    i

     
  9. What does this code print out?
     
     word = "Simpson"
     for letter in word:
         print(letter)
     
    S
    i
    m
    p
    s
    o  
    n

 10. What does this code print out?
     
     word = "Simpson"
     for i in range(3):
         word += "College"
     print(word)
     
     SimpsonCollegeCollegeCollege
     
 11. What does this code print out?
     
     word = "Hi" * 3
     print(word)
    
     HiHiHi

 12. What does this code print out?
     
     my_text = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs."
     print("The 3rd spot is: " + my_text[3])
     print("The -1 spot is: " + my_text[-1])
     
    The 3rd spot is:  
    The -1 spot is: .
     
 13. What does this code print out?
     
     s = "0123456789"
     print(s[1])
     print(s[:3])
     print(s[3:])
     
    1
    012
    3456789
     
 14. Write a loop that will take in a list of five numbers from the user, adding
     each to an array. Then print the array. Try doing this without looking at the
     book.
    
     user_input_list = []
    user_input = input("Enter 5 numbers: ")
    for number in user_input:
        user_input_list.append(number)
    print(user_input_list)
     
 15. Write a program that take an array like the following, and print the average.
     Use the len function, don't just use 15, because that won't work if
     the list size changes.
     (There is a sum function I haven't told you about. Don't use that.
     Sum the numbers individually as shown in the chapter.)
     
    item_sum = 0
    my_list = [3,12,3,5,3,4,6,8,5,3,5,6,3,2,4]
    for item in my_list:
    item_sum += item
    print(item_sum/len(my_list))
