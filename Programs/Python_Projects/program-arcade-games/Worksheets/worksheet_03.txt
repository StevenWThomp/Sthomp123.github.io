  1. What is missing from this code? (1 pt)
     This code is missing a second parentheses after the temperature input
     temperature = float(input("Temperature: ")
     if temperature > 90:
         print("It is hot outside.")
     else:
         print("It is not hot out.")
     This code is missing a second parentheses to close float()
     
  2. Write a Python program that will take in a number from the user and print
     if it is positive, negative, or zero. Use a proper if/elif/else chain, don't
     just use three if statements.

     number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
     if number > 0:
        print("This number is positive")
    elif number < 0:
        print("this number is negative")
    else:
        print("this number is zero")
     
  3. Write a Python program that will take in a number from a user and print
     out ``Success'' if it is greater than -10 and less than 10, inclusive. (1 pt)
     number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
     if -10 <= number <= 10:
        print("Success")

  4. This runs, but there is something wrong. What is it? (1 pt)
     You get asked for the input before you see the options.
     user_input = input("A cherry is a: ")
     print("A. Dessert topping")
     print("B. Desert topping")
     if user_input.upper() == "A":
         print("Correct!")
     else:
         print("Incorrect.")
	C O R R E C T E D
	print("A. Dessert topping")
    print("B. Desert topping")
    user_input = input("A cherry is a: ")
   if user_input.upper() == "A":
        print("Correct!")
    else:
		print("Incorrect.")
	
  
  
  5.  There are two things wrong with this code that tests if x is set to a
     positive value. One prevents it from running, and the other is subtle.
     Make sure the if statement works no matter what x is set to.
     Identify both issues. (2 pts)
     1: there is a == when assigning x
	 2: X will always be equal to 4. If you want to change what x is set to then you can use an input() statenent.
     x == 4
     if x >= 0:
         print("x is positive.")
     else:
         print("x is not positive.")
     
  6. What three things are wrong with the following code? (3 pts)
     1. use a double == in the if statement.
	 2. you want to use int(input() when trying to enter numbers
	 3. There is no colon in the if statement.
     x = input("Enter a number: ")
     if x = 3
		 print("You entered 3")
     
  7. There are four things wrong with this code. Identify all four issues. (4 pts)
     
	 1. There is no double == in the if statement.
	 2. Else statement is indented.
	 3. else statement has no colon.
	 4. the print statement inside the else statement has no indention.
     
	 answer = input("What is the name of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's assistant? ")
     if a = "Beaker":
         print("Correct!")
         else
         print("Incorrect! It is Beaker.")
     
  8. This program doesn't work correctly. What is wrong? (1 pt)
     You to write it as: if x == "Happy" or x == "Glad":
	 
     x = input("How are you today?")
     if x == "Happy" or "Glad":
         print("That is good to hear!")
     
  9. Look at the code below. Write you best guess here on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct.
     Clearly label your guess and the actual answer.
     Also, if this or any other example results in an error, make sure to
     state that an error occurred.
     While you don't need to write an explanation, make sure you understand
     why the computer prints what it does. Don't get caught flat-footed when
     you need to know later. (2 pts)
     My guess: buzz will be printed.
	 The answer: buzz was printed.
	 This is because x gets assigned the value 5, the new variables are checking if they are equal to 5. This is why "y" was returned as False
	 while "z" was returned as True.
     x = 5
     y = x == 6
     z = x == 5
     print("x=", x)
     print("y=", y)
     print("z=", z)
     if y:
         print("Fizz")
     if z:
         print("Buzz")
     
 10. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
	 My guess: I think it will print numbers in the print statements that correct. If they are incorrect I think it will error.
     Correct asnwer: It did not print numbers and it did not error. Instead it gave me True and False answers.
     x = 5
     y = 10
     z = 10
     print(x < y)
     print(y < z)
     print(x == 5)
     print(not x == 5)
     print(x != 5)
     print(not x != 5)
     print(x == "5")
     print(5 == x + 0.00000000001)
     print(x == 5 and y == 10)
     print(x == 5 and y == 5)
     print(x == 5 or y == 5)
     
 11. Look at the code below. Write you best guess on what it will print.
     Next, run the code and see if you are correct. (2 pts)
     My guess: This will give me true and false answers.
	 Correct Answer: After fixing the error, it gave me true and false answers.
	 ERROR: The first time I ran it I got a typerror for the line "print(3 < "3")"
	 I got this error because it is checking if an integer is less than a string.
     print("3" == "3")
     print(" 3" == "3")
     print(3 < 4)
     print(3 < 10)
     print("3" < "4")
     print("3" < "10")
     print( (2 == 2) == "True" )
     print( (2 == 2) == True )
     print(3 < "3")
     

 12. What things are wrong with this section of code?
     The programmer wants to set the money variable according to
     the initial occupation the user selects. (1 pt)
    
	 They need to use == in the if statements
	 They could also shorten the else if statements by just using elif.
     print("Welcome to Oregon Trail!")

     print("A. Banker")
     print("B. Carpenter")
     print("C. Farmer")

     user_input = input("What is your occupation?")

     if user_input = A:
         money = 100
     else if user_input = B:
         money = 70
     else if user_input = C:
         money = 50
