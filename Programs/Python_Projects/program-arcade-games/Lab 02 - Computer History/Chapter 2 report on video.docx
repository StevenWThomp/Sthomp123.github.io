The history of computers

I watched part 3 of the Triumph of the Nerds documentary. It starts out talking about the release of Windows 95, and how the exploitation of opportunities allowed microsoft to make Bill Gates the “master of the gui universe”, but most of the ideas that came in Windows 95 were thought of over two decades ago inside of a think tank in Palo Alto that was started by Xerox.They called it PARC. It was said that out of the top 100 computer researchers in the world that 58 of them worked at PARC. That was confusing because PARC only had 50 researchers. These researchers had everything that they wanted. There was complete intellectual freedom and everyone was challenging ideas. Back in 1973, these people built a personal computer that they called the “Alto” it was never for sale and cost around $10000 to create, but if it was never built, we probably wouldn’t have windows or macintosh computers. The Alto was considered “Friendly and intuitive” it had the first gui that used a mouse to get information from the screen, it linked to other computers using ethernet, and it printed everything that was on the screen straight to a laser printer. Sadly, the researchers are PARC were unable to persuade Xerox that what they had made was the future. There was a huge mismatch between what the researchers were doing and what the managers were doing. The managers didn’t understand the vision that was getting created so there was nobody able to receive that vision.

Steve Jobs toured the Xerox PARC facility in December of 1979. He said that they showed him three things but he didn’t pay attention to anything except for the first one. He was blindsided by the graphical user interface that was shown to him. It was obvious to him that all computers would run off of a gui in the future. A gui allowed a computer to be easy for anyone to use. Steve Jobs understood what the gui meant after seeing it for just a mere hour. The PARC researchers had been showing the executives their interface for years but they just didn’t get it. Steve Jobs persuaded the Apple board to invest in technology that copied what he had seen had Xerox PARC. They started building a new computer and codenamed it “Lisa”, but Lisa got too expensive and it didn’t work properly. 

The computer industry has changed drastically since this documentary was created. Graphical User Interfaces are everywhere nowadays. Steve Jobs was right about his prediction. Almost everything we do that involves technology uses a gui. The computer industry is the third largest industry in the world and it’s growing larger everyday. We are nearing a point where cars can drive themselves and we may only be a decade or two away from robots that are smarter than humans.
