    <h2>Rule an Ancient City</h2>
    --------------------
    <p>Towers and Temples is the winner of the 2017 Palmer 
    Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game. 
    Players adopt role cards of characters from ancient 
    Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage 
    the administration of a city. <br>Each role provides 
    a different ability and strategy. However, 
    one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players 
    must be constantly aware of betrayal 
    and double-cross. <br>This card game provides a ton 
    of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players 
    and expansion packs available for larger parties.</p>

    <p>This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must 
    carefully choose his or her roles and 
    the strategies can quickly change with the turn 
    of a card. However the level of randomness is 
    just right and cunning and resourcefulness can 
    overcome bad luck (if given time.) <br>I do not 
    recommend this game unless there are at least 4 
    players; less than that reduces the intrigue 
    and some of the game appeal.</p>

    <h2>Highly Recommended</h2>
    ------------------
    <p>Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is 
    just about perfect and each player must 
    carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the 
    strategic possibilities are nearly endless, 
    the game is simple to learn. <br>The replay value is 
    high and gets even better when you replace 
    some of the cards with new cards available in the 
    expansion packs.</p>

    <h2>Great Strategic Board Game</h2>
    ------------------
    <p>We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2 
    to 6 players and we can strongly 
    recommend the game. The different phases of the 
    game are interesting and intriguing, from
    bluffing and stealing to site construction and planning. 
    <br>With the variety of cards and 
    scenarios, no two games are ever quite the same. It's 
    a great introduction to the world of 
    strategic board games and role playing.</p>

    <h2>An Incredible Game</h2>
    ------------------
    <p>The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent 
    and one of the best around. As 
    for play, this game offers lots of strategy, and there 
    are tough decisions to make every 
    turn. It's not only important to select the character 
    that increases your chances for scoring, 
    <br>but also to anticipate the characters the opponents 
    are likely to select, and then hedge against 
    their availability. This causes a lot of unpredictability 
    and deep strategic thinking. However, 
    it can still be played at a more basic level for 
    younger users.</p>

    <p>We had a lot of fun with this game and rate it as 
    Best in its Class. Highly recommended.</p>
